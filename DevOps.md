## Introduction to DevOps

### Traditional model of development

Consists of Development, Realease and Support team.

Development creates Software. Release deploys software. Support maintains software.

Not tightly coupled and have nothing to do with each other.

### DevOps model of development

Aims for closer collaboration between these 3 teams to improve and shorten the dev lify cycle.

To be able to measure certain metrics and to be able to provide good support software needs to be designed with operations and support in mind.

### Principles

Everyone is responsible for everything.

Everything than can be automated should be automated.

Measure first, change later.

### DevOps Toolchain

Plan -> Code -> Build -> Test -> Release -> Deploy -> Operate -> Monitor
